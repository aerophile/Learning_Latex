# Learning LaTeX

A good place to begin is [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6ez7sbaiWc). It has a basic introduction as well as Installation instructions along with very simplehelloworld type examples.

Then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-kXtWdjtmw) one is also another good introductory video where a bit about sections is also introduced. 

Finally, [this video](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) talks more about configuration changes to Texmaker which are useful as well as some more information into linebreaks and equations.
