Learning a bit more \LaTeX\  today.\\

We can enter into Math mode by using the dollar sign, so I can write about equations like $(x+5=3)$ .  To exit math mode and mark the end of that equation, another dollar sign must be put at the end. \\

Another equation? coming right up as $(x+9)$. Thank God for dollar signs.

Alright, so apparently double backslashes also star a new indented paragraphs. If that is to be avoided and we can just use the return key twice.

This works too !\\
This is a double slash kind of break

This is not.

So the Math mode that has been used aove is called "inlay Math mode" and there's another type called "display Math mode". To use that we use the dollar sign twice at both the beginning and the end of the equation. Its useful to set the equation apart and have it displayed in its own line. So it works like this $$Y = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3y^2x +1$$

That's all for now.
